    <p><em>Which courses encouraged you to identify  theoretical, conceptual, or methodological 
connections between your chosen concentration disciplines? How did they encourage 
this identification ( through subject matter, readings, lectures, course work, project work, 
mentorship, etc.)?</em></p>

<p>Interactive Art and Computational Design, Experimental Capture and Physical 
Computing helped me make connections between art and computer science. Although these 
courses didn’t involve any of the theoretical aspects of computer science, they nevertheless 
gave me the chance to apply programming skills toward the creation of artworks. All the 
assignments in these courses required programming.</p>

<p><em>Which courses helped you to apply these connections and integrate or combine your 
concentrations (through experiments, exercises, research projects, creative projects, 
etc.)? What assignments allowed you to produce this kind of interdisciplinary work?</em></p>

<p>Since I often work with code as a material, I was able to integrate my knowledge of 
programming with artistic projects that I pursued in Contextual Practice, Urban Intervention, 
Sound Art and Digitally Mediated Performance. In this sense, most of the assignments I did for 
these courses were interdisciplinary.</p>

<p><em>In which courses do you feel you improved your communication skills, either in written, 
visual, or oral expression? Which assignments show most clearly your skills in this area?</em></p>

<p>Through regular written assignments, I was able to practice my writing skills in the 
Philosophy of Social Science, Modern Visual Culture, and Aesthetics of Dysfunction. I was able 
to practice my oral skills in preparation for my sophomore review in Contextual Practice. The 
essays that I wrote in Aesthetics of Dysfunction and Modern Visual Culture most clearly show 
my development as a writer.</p>

<p><em>Which courses allowed you to explore local and global perspectives on culture, society, 
and history? Which assignments pushed you to investigate and expand these 
perspectives?</em></p>

<p>Contextual Practice encouraged me to consider the contextual aspects of artmaking: 
how an artwork relates to its site and audience or participants. The assignments for this course 
required that we make work in response to specific contexts, which inevitably raises questions 
of society, culture and history. 
Contextual practice</p>

<p><em>In which courses were you able to engage in both theoretical and practical work to 
produce real-world knowledge? How did the assignments for these courses encourage 
the application of theory to practical knowledge?</em></p>

<p>The interdisciplinary courses I’ve taken have all been project based, that is, they 
required me to produce artworks rather than any kind of applicable, real-world knowledge.</p>

<p><em>Which courses encouraged you to think more about how decision-making on both the 
individual and social levels is informed by cognitive, behavioral, societal, and ethical 
issues? Which assignments allowed you to more closely examine how these issues 
affect decisions?</em></p>

<p>Philosophy of Social Science explored how social scientists model human decision-
making. The assignments focused on the philosophical implications on various approaches to 
understanding decision-making in social science.</p>

<p><em>In which courses did you encounter hardship, difficulty, or struggle with course material 
or assignments? Which assignments challenged you (intellectually, personally) the 
most?</em></p>

<p>Courses in computer science which involved proof-based mathematics challenged me 
the most. Assignments in which I had to carefully reason about the correctness of particular 
proposition proved to be challenging for me.</p>

<p><em>What areas do you feel are undeveloped or have been untouched by your previous, to-
date course experiences? If so, why do you think that is? (Lack of opportunity/time 
constraints, lack of options, etc.) Are there courses you still wish to take that will allow 
you to achieve the kinds of opportunities for integration and application of your 
concentrations as outlined above? If you believe there is no such class at CMU, what 
kind of courses do you think would have fostered these experiences?</em></p>

<p>I wish to take courses in the humanities that involve research and writing. Most of my 
courses have involved art-making or analytical reasoning, but very few have focused on 
theoretical reasoning, research and argumentation. I feel that my education could be greatly 
enriched by humanities courses.</p>
