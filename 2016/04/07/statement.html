    <p>I began my CMU career in the School of Art, which the intention of transferring into the BCSA program. Early on, I made frequent use of code in my artwork, and took classes like which encouraged the creative use of technology.</p>

<p>Since transferring to the BCSA in my sophomore year, I’ve come to realize that while aspects of computer science are relevant to my creative work, it’s difficult to integrate the more theoretical aspects of computer science with the creation of artworks. While it’s possible to make artwork that draws heavily from an academic field like computer science, it’s not something I often feel compelled to do. Instead, I apply general skills related to computer science in order to solve particular visual or technical problems. Some of these general skills, like the ability to prove statements, or to approach an esoteric programming language, will have practical use to me in my creative work. I also think aspects machine learning and artificial intelligence are relevant to my practice, so I plan to take elective courses about these topics in my last year. Overall, I think I overestimated the relevance of computer science to my art.</p>

<p>All that being said, I think studying computer science will help me to find a job. I don’t intend to enter the commercial art world for many years, if ever, so I will hopefully use my programming skills to support for my art practice.</p>

<p>This year, I am looking forward to taking studio courses like senior studio. So far, I’ve mostly taken art classes in the new media category, and while I appreciate what these courses have taught me, I’m strictly concerned with use of technology as an expressive tool. I want the ideas that underlie my work to be in dialogue with art history and culture, rather than technological novelty. I feel increasingly alienated from the field of new media art, which in my opinion focuses on innovation at the expense of feeling.</p>

<p>While I’ve been learning about art and computer science, my writing and research skills have atrophied. In my last year, I want to take humanities courses and art history courses to address this. I’m more excited by artist-writers like Paul Chan, Robert Smithson and Michael Craig-Martin than I am by art theorists. I want to learn to use writing as a tool to develop and communicate aspects of my thinking that aren’t evident in the work itself.</p>

<p>After school, I plan to apply to MFA programs like Bard and Columbia. Before I do that, I’ll need to work for a year or more so that I can afford an expensive MFA. Since those programs are self-directed, I don’t want to enter grad school without a clear sense of how I’ll use that time to develop my practice. Before I enter grad school, I may take courses at BHQFU, a free art school in New York. I think it will be important for me to befriend and eventually collaborate with other young artists, since it’s hard to contribute to a discourse if you’re not part of a community.</p>
