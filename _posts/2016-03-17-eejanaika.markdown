Ee Ja Nai Ka were carnivalesque celebrations that occurred at the end of the Edo period in Japan, from June 1867 to May 1868. Paper talismans fell from the sky and served as a pretext for frenzied dancing and orgiastic behavior. The Ee Ja Nai Ka movement can be read as a form of protest during a tense period of transition on the eve of Japanâ€™s modernization. It stems from a utopian belief in Yonaoshi, or world renewal, which promised improved conditions for peasants living in abject poverty.
